Headline: I am a passionate Frontend Developer as well as a 3D Modeler who loves learning and experimenting new technologies.

Bio:
My name is Mary, migrated to US from Dubai in Dec 2011. I am currently enrolled in Full-stack Engineering program at Thinkful. I also hold two university degrees, in Computer Science and Game Design.
I love coding because my brain feeds on the challenge; I am very eager to work as a web application developer where I can fulfill both skill-sets and bring my ideas to life.

When Iâ€™m not coding/designing, I love to do outdoor activities with friends and family, I love camping, BBQing, Beach, new exciting adventures, reading and learning new things, planting and painting, my next challenge is to learn piano (my favorite instrument). 

I have a small senior dog that I love to death. His name is Hazelnut!
